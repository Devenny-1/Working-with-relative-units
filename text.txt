ems 
 They’re nice for padding, margins, and element sizing, but when it comes to font size,
 they can get complicated. Thankfully, there is a better option—rems.

  My default is to use rems for font sizes, pixels for borders, and ems for most other mea
sures, especially paddings, margins, and border radius (though I favor the use of per
centages for container widths when necessary).
 This way, font sizes are predictable, but you’ll still get the power of ems scaling
 your padding and margins, should other factors alter the font size of an element. Pix
els make sense for borders, particularly when you want a nice fine line. These are my
 go-to units for the various properties, but again, they’re tools, and in some circum
stances, a different tool does the job better.
 TIP When in doubt, use rems for font size, pixels for borders, and ems for most other
 properties

 certain screen sizes or media types (for example, print or screen). This is a
 key component of responsive design
